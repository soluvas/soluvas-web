# The IniShiroFilter configuration is very powerful and flexible, while still remaining succinct.
# Please read the org.apache.shiro.web.servlet.IniShiroFilter JavaDoc for information.

# Quick Tip: Instead of having this configuration here in web.xml, you can instead
# move all of this to a 'shiro.ini' file at the root of the classpath and remove
# the 'config' init-param. Or you can specify the 'configPath' init-param and specify the
# path to a resource at any location (url, file or classpath). This may be desired if the
# config gets long and you want to keep web.xml clean.
